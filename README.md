# Snatds
Welcome to the repository for SnaTDS (Snake and Truth or Dare). This is a 3D Snake & Ladder game with an exciting twist of truth and dare, developed using GDScript, Godot Engine, and Blender. This project was created as part of the Syntax Error Hackathon.

Explore the code to see how we combined classic gameplay with interactive challenges. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
